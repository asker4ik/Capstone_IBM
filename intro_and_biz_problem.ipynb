    "<p>Toronto is the provincial capital of Ontario and the most populous city in Canada, with a population of 2,731,571 in 2016. The city is the anchor of the Golden Horseshoe, an urban agglomeration of 9,245,438 people (as of 2016) surrounding the western end of Lake Ontario. Toronto is an international centre of business, finance, arts, and culture, and is recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world.<p>\n",
    "<p>The diverse population of Toronto reflects its current and historical role as an important destination for immigrants to Canada. More than 50 percent of residents belong to a visible minority population group, and over 200 distinct ethnic origins are represented among its inhabitants. While the majority of Torontonians speak English as their primary language, over 160 languages are spoken in the city.<p>\n",
    "<p>The city is home to the Toronto Stock Exchange, the headquarters of Canada's five largest banks, and the headquarters of many large Canadian and multinational corporations. Its economy is highly diversified with strengths in technology, design, financial services, life sciences, education, arts, fashion, business services, environmental innovation, food services, and tourism.<p>\n",
    "    As we will see later in the project Toronto has around 250 different categories of restaurants within the city limits. Hence it's increasingly difficult for an entrepreneur to find the best place to open a new restaurant of a specific kind. \n",
    "The goal of this project will be to analyze the geospatial data of the city and also the Foursquare venue data to determine the best location to open a certain restaurant. As an entrepreneur myself I know how hard it is to start, so I hope that this project will be helpful for new business people with their ideas."
